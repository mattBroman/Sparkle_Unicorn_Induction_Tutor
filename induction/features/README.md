# Using Cucumber

The basics that I could find online from a few examples

To run just type "cucumber -S" or "rake cucumber"

## Added funcitonality

In addition to having cucumber, Cucumber-Training-Wheels will add actions for us like
* when I am on 'this page'
  * Go to support/ and in the paths.rb file add the path you're searching for by matching with regex
  * I did an example of this for the pattern /^home\s?page$/ mapping to '/'
