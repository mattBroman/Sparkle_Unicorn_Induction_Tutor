# Using Cucumber

The basics that I could find online from a few examples

## Added funcitonality

In addition to having cucumber I added Cucumber training wheels that will preform actions for us like
* when I am on 'this page'
  * Go to support/ and in the paths.rb file add the path you're searching for by matching with regex
  * I did an example of this for the pattern /^home\s?page$/ mapping to '/'
